		<p>Here's a story that I wrote. It's titled MONEY MIND.<br>
			
Chapter 1: Mike's Mind (20th July 2026)
	"What do you think?" asked the man in a three piece suit. "I think it's your call" replied another man. This one was wearing a two piece suit. It did have an 
eldridge knot though. Both looked respectable. They were watching the game of a lifetime on the television. "Alright", he suddenly said, "I bet a Thousand 
bucks James will score a 100". "I hope so", the man repied. "He's at 96, and Shawn's balling" he said. The ball left Henry's hand, onto the pitch, and 'THWACK', 
the sound could be heard clearly from the silence. Mike's heart stopped. The ball went high. He was about to breathe out in relief, when the ball, which he 
hoped would go for a six, landed in the hands of the fielder stationed at the long leg. "Ha!", Gregor chuckled. "It's my luck", Mike said, "I really hoped he 
would've reached a century". "Yeah, me too" Gregor replied, with a horse's smile on his face. "But you owe me one grand now" he added. "Of course, treat's on me
tomorrow." The friendship of Mike and Gregor can be traced to a long time back. Before Mike married Janet, or even after, if you asked him who he prefers to 
spend his time with, his answer will always be the same. In fact, it was Gregor who introduced Mike to the world of Cricket. 
	The next day, Mike took Gregor to "The Opulent Palate", as he promised him a treat. The restaurant was known for it's unparalleled luxury dining experience, 
creative food ideas, and flawless taste. The food there was better than art, it was perfection. And the music in the background was the cherry on top. As they
finished with their dining, "Gregor," Mike said, "You know I got my bonus yesterday". "Wasn't that obvious? You never bet such a huge amount on anything"
Gregor replied. "Let me finish" Mike said. "I want to gift Janet something, our anniversary's next week, and I have no clue what to do for her"."How can I 
help buddy?" Gregor asked. "Well, you've known her since childhood, suggest something". Gregor was lost in deep thought for the next minute. Mike sighed, his
disappointment was obvious. Gregor immediately replied "She did always say she wanted to go to Paris". "Well then, Paris it is. Thanks man" Mike said. Gregor
replied, "Anytime mate". Both walked out of the restaurant with smiling faces. Gregor went straight to the subway two blocks across the street. Mike sat in his
Bentley, and drove away. Two hours later, Mike was sitting in his office, when Gregor called him. Mike was a bit busy, so he ignored the call. Mike was the 
Manager of Infinitex Cyber Services, and he had recieved news that their CEO Charlie Woodwyn was arriving in their branch. Gregor left a message, saying it was
urgent. Mike was worried. Just as Charlie was walking through the door, Janet started called him. "What could be happening?" Mike thought to himself. Charlie 
looked at Mike's face, and immediately asked, "Whats up Mike? You look worried. Everything alright?". "Yes sir, everything's fine. Thank you for asking." This
formality was just in front of other employees. Charlie and Mike were close friends, although not as close as Mike and Gregor. Charlie knew something was not 
right, and gave him the rest of the day off. Mike immediately called Gregor. "I got your message, everything okay?" Mike asked in a worried tone. "No, 
nothing is okay. Remember I told you not to invest in Prodigy? I was right to be skeptical. They just declared Bankruptcy". Mike almost started crying. "What!
I had invested over a million. But the Wall Street Guy said...", before Mike could continue, Gregor yelled from over the phone, "Screw what the Wall Street Guy
said. I told you not to do it, and you did it anyway. All your money that you invested in Progidy Group, it's gone." Mike was literally on the verge of crying.
He then called Janet, and asked her what happened. "My parents, they're missing". Mike could hear Janet crying over the phone. Could this day get any worse? 
Hopefully not. 
	Mike rushed to his in-laws place. It was a humble home, far from the city life, in the comfortable countryside. Apart from his own house, it was the only 
Mike felt happy. When Janet came to visit her parents, the door was open, and nobody was home. "Mom! Dad!" she shouted. No response. She called them on their 
phone, but in vain. They were inside the house. Janet checked their neighbour, Mr Robinson's house. "Janet! When did you come back? Come on in" he said in 
his always-happy tone. "Maybe later Mr. Robinson. Are my parents with you?" she asked, worried. "No honey. Are they not at home?" he asked back. "Have you checked
the park? They sometimes like to take a stroll these days". "They're not there. and even their phones are in the house. They didn't even lock the door." she said.
"Well that's news to me" he said. "I've even tried calling Mike, he won't take my phone." Mr Robinson pointed out, "Isn't that Mike's car?" Mike rushed towards 
Janet. "Have you tried calling them?" he asked. "Yes" she replied. "Their phones are on the couch" she added. "Janet, why don't you look for something in the 
house?" Mr Robinson said. "Maybe you will find something" he added. "Okay, Mike do me a favor. Contact Inspecter McMillion" Janet said, as she walked towards the
house. "Mike," Mr. Robinson whispered. "Don't tell this to Janet. I overheard some people talking over at the cattle farm that her parents invested in some 
scheme". "What kind of scheme?" asked Mike. "I don't know, but pretty sure it had something to do with someone named Gregor". Mike's heart stopped. "Gregor?" he 
asked. Mr. Robinson reassured it was Gregor's name that he heard. "Okay, Mr. Robinson. Thanks for the information" replied Mike. Mike tried to reach McMillion, 
but there was no response. Mike called Gregor, hoping he would have some answers, but no response from there either. Janet came back from the house, looking 
worried. "Did you try calling Gregor?" she asked. "Yes" replied Mike. "He didn't answer my calls". "That's weird. He never ignores your calls", Janet said. 
"Alright, I've gotta go. If you need any help, let me know" Mr. Robinson said, as he walked towards the cattle farm at the back of their house. "I think Gregor
has some of the answers we seek", Mike said. Janet, looking worried, asked "Well, what are you gonna do?" Janet asked. "I'm about to find out what he has been
upto these days" Mike said. "What do you mean?" Janet asked. Mike assured her he would take care of the matter, and asked her to go back home."Mike, I'm afraid" 
Janet said while crying. "I promise I will find your parents honey" Mike re-assured her. The couple sat in the Bentley at dusk. Mike dropped her off at their 
house. "Take care honey" he said. "Will you come back home tonight?" Janet asked. "I can't say for sure. Lock the house tightly, and do not let anyone inside" 
Mike said. "And if you feel afraid, you know where to find me". "You're going to Gregor's place, aren't you?" Janet asked. Mike, wiping the tear off her eyes
said "I'm going to find some answers. You know, they treated me like their son after my parents passed. I'll make sure whoever did this answers for their deed."
Saying that, he rushed his car to Gregor's house. He entered the house. Too late. Gregor was on the run. "I'll get him, sooner or later" Mike said to himself. 
	Mike returned home. Janet, still worried, asked "What happened?". "He escaped. I don't think we have a choice but to inform...", while Janet interrupted 
"No, anyone but Daniel Ramsay". "We don't have a choice. I tried to reach inspector McMillion. He didn't respond". "Fine. But I want my parents back"."I know"
Mike reported the incident to Detective Daniel Ramsay. Detective Ramsay was a man of many words. He always wore a black suit, and had a cigar in his mouth.
He was a short, chubby man who stopped at nothing to solve a mystery. His weird ways earned him a reputation. He once covered himself in mud and snuck up into
an abandoned factory just outside the city, which he suspected was the location of a smuggling business. This got him the nickname "Detective Mudslide". 
	"We'll have to start by tracking down your buddy Gregor, then we'll look into Henry Bollister" Detective Ramsay said in his broken voice. "Why Henry?"
Mike asked. "He's the CEO of Prodigy Group, right? Maybe he'll have something to say about why he didn't use his overseas investment to cover up his Bankruptcy."
"Fair enough. But Janet's parents?". "I think they are connected to this somehow. Don't worry. We'll find them". Just as Mike was about to enter his Bentley, 
he got a call from his office. "Hello?". Over the phone, "Mike, I got Good News and Bad News. Which one do you want to hear first?". "Give me the good news."
"Well, you're now the CEO of Infinitex Cyber Services"."What! What about Charlie?". "That's the bad news. Charlie passed away an hour ago. He died of a sudden
heart attack. He mentioned to some of the partners he wanted you to become CEO after him". As Mike heard this, tears flowed down his cheeks. He did not know if
these were tears of joy or grief. Should he mourn the loss of his friend, or should he celebrate the biggest promotion of his life. "This is not the time to 
celebrate." Mike thought to himself. "The company is my responsibility now. I will not disappoint you, Charlie. May your sould rest in peace". 
	Detective Ramsay asked Mike to give him the photos of Janet's parents. Ramsay went to Gregor's house at dawn. Hopping from one room to another, he hoped to
find somthing. "Bulls-eye..." He said to himself when he found a photograph. "Gregor sure left the house in a hurry. He forgot to burn this photo". He looked
at the photo for hours. When Mike came to Detective Ramsay's office with the photographs he had asked for, he was left speechless. "That's Janet's parents. 
Where did you get that photo?" Mike asked, surprised. "From Gregor's house. Seems he left in a hurry. And I think I found their location too". "Where are they?"
"Take a guess" Detective said in that god-awful voice. "Don't play mind games with me detective, I'm already stressed", Mike said. He was visibly frustrated.
"Alright, but first, I think we need to pay a visit to two fine gentlemen", the detective said. "Who?" asked Mike. "Well, their names are Bob and Chris. Does
that ring any bells?". "Nope" Mike said. "Well, we're about to find out" he said as they sat in an old Ford. It was the detective's ride. Detective Ramsay tried 
to start his car. "The damn thing won't start", the detective complained in that god-awful voice. 
"Let's just go in my Bentley", Mike said, as the duo got out of the old Ford, and got in the Bentley.
