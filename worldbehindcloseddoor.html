      The World Behind The Closed Door
	"What's your name?", asked the tallest man in a group of four. They seemed like 'the bullies of the Montville', all having a cigarette in their mouths. "My 
name is Sam", the man responded, in a scared voice. "Sam, huh...? Never seen you before. You new around here?", asked the same man. "Yes", replied Sam. He was an 
introvert, and not quite used to speaking to others, let alone the bullies. And as luck would have it, he wasn't rich either. Well, atleast not as rich as one
would have expected him to be, considering the way he dressed. He lived alone in a house at the corner of the street. 
	It was the third birthday of Mr. Phil's only grandson. And everyone was invited, except Sam. Mr. Phil was a retired Physical Director at Montville University.
And he was the only person who the bullies feared. As soon as Mr. Phil learned that 'Sam the New Guy' wasn't invited, he immediately sent an invitation towards 
Sam's house. Mr. Phil's house was small, only having space for two. It could not have fit the entire community of Montville. So, the park located next to the 
Mayor's office was selected as the venue. Everyone came by early. Mr. Phil escorted Sam to a corner. "I'm extremely sorry for the late invitation Sam. I hope 
you understand", said Mr. Phil. "It's fine...", Sam replied, with a smile. He was having some problems settling in, and Mr. Phil was the first person who had 
shown him some humanity. "If you don't mind, Mr. Phil, I noticed you and your grandson live alone. Where are his parents?" Sam asked, hoping to know more about 
him. "Well, Jacob's mother died during childbirth, and my son Michael passed away two years ago. Since then, it's been just me with the young man." Mr. Phil 
replied. "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that", said Sam. All through the party, people stared at him as if he didn't belong there, treated him like an outsider. 
	Montville was supposed to be a loving community, yet they had every feeling but love towards Sam. After the party, he went to his house. He sat down on his 
worn-out couch, and stared at the old portrait hanging from his front wall in silence. After about a minute, a tear drop rolled down his cheek. Sam wiped it off
and went to bed. As he was sleeping, he had a weird dream. He was standing in front of a closet behind his couch. When he was about to open the door, he woke up. 
Realising it was just a dream, he went back to sleep. He almost forgot about it the next morning. But then, his gaze turned towards the old, dusty portrait 
hanging from the wall. Upon careful inspection, Sam noticed that the eyes of the man in the portrait were pointing straight to the closet across the room. He then 
remembered his dream. Curiosity got the best of him, and before he knew it, he was standing in front of the closet. He opened the door, and there was... nothing.
During the first glance, it seemed the closet was empty, full of dust. But, after five minutes of investigation, Sam found a 'door' at the bottom. He did 
not want to open it just yet. He went out of Montville for a full week. 
	"Let's make sure this misfit regrets coming here", the bully was shouting, leading the four bullies. They threw rocks through his glass windows. But their 
attempts failed, as Sam was not even there. Upon his return, Sam saw the broken windows, and immediately realised the bullies wanted to send a message. He went 
to Mr. Phil. "What's wrong Sam? What happened?" he asked, recognizing the look on his face. It was the look of disappointment. "Why would you do that? Why did 
you send those bullies to my house?", asked Sam. Mr. Phil replied, "I wanted you out of town. You don't belong here" replied Mr. Phil. "I must say I am impressed.
How did you find out it was me?" asked Mr. Phil. Sam looked at Mr. Phil, shocked and hurt by his words. He had believed that Mr. Phil was the only person who 
showed him some kindness and humanity in Montville. Now, he couldn't understand why Mr. Phil wanted him out of town. "I didn't want to believe it was you," Sam 
said. Mr. Phil let out a sigh and sat down, motioning for Sam to do the same. "I know I may have seemed kind to you, and I'm sorry for any false impression I 
may have given," he began. "But you see, I blame myself for my son's death. He died in an accident while driving to visit me. I couldn't bear the guilt, and I 
felt responsible for not being there for him when he needed me the most", he added. "He was an introvert like you, and I didn't want you around to influence 
Jacob in a similar way. I was afraid I was going to lose my grandson just like I lost my son. Please forgive me Sam", he said, with his eyes filled with 
tears of guilt. "It's fine, Mr. Phil. But sending me away will not stop the world from throwing challenges in Jacob's way", replied Sam. "But I don't understand.
How did you figure it was me?", asked Mr. Phil. "The bullies did not just wake up one day and decided they wanted me gone, they're not smart enough to do that. 
And the only person who has any kind of influence over them is you, so I figured it was you", replied Sam. "Wow, you're shy, but you sure ain't dumb", said 
Mr. Phil laughing. 
	Sam returned to his house. As soon as he entered, he saw the closet, about which he had almost forgotten. He had to open it. And the big, dusty wooden 
closet was opened. The settled dust started flying around, causing him to cough. When he was about to open the 'door' at the bottom, something caught his eye.
It was behind the stack of old papers and clothes. When Sam took all of the papers and kept them aside, the object that caught his eye was revealed to be a 
mouse's skeleton. He was surprised that there was no rotten smell inside the closet. This was testimony that the closet was very old. Before opening the 'door', 
he wanted to look at the old papers that covered the dead mouse. 
	As he read through those old sheets yellowed by time, he found details of how a certain Fredric Pollmann went to an old, abandoned mansion in the outskirts 
of Oakhurst. He encountered some interesting people on his way there, and even got robbed once, but did not find anything supernatural about the mansion. But 
one sheet stood out from the others. It was written by a certain 'William Dubry'. This name sounded familiar to Sam. he turned towards the portrait across the 
room. It was the portrait of William Dubry. William was the great grandfather of Charles Dubry, the previous owner of the house. According to William's writings, 
there was something strange, something precious beyond the 'door'. "Thats it", Sam thought to himself, as he went to open the door. It creaked open, and a narrow 
passage revealed itself. It was darker than the darkest of caves near the mountains of Oakhurst. As Sam descended into the darkness, he started sweating 
profusely. After 2 hours of descent, he reached a large space. He took his flashlight and shined it into the room, hoping to get an estimate of it's size. It was 
unfathomably large. Sam realised it was a gold mine. "A literal gold mine inside my house!", he thought to himself. The walls of the vast underground chamber 
glistened with a golden hue, reflecting the light of Sam's flashlight.  This hidden chamber held riches beyond imagination, a literal treasure trove beneath his 
very feet. This was what William Dubry had written about in those sheets. He picked up an old, torn notebook. He took it upstairs, and spent hours solving the 
jig-saw	puzzle, carefully piecing together the torn notebooks. It revealed that apart from the gold mines, there was also a treasure chest which contained 
precious gemstones brought by William Dubry when he first settled near Montville. Sam spent the next few hours searching frantically for the treasure chest.
And there it was, lying in a dusty corner. But someone else, on the other side of the world had his eyes on the chest too. It was a Chinese Businessman named 
Li Wei. He usually got what he wanted, like a spoilt child getting his wishes, but will he get what he wants now?
