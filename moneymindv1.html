Chapter 1: Mike's Mind <br>
	"What do you think?" asked the man in a three piece suit. "I think it's your call" replied another man. This one was wearing a two piece suit. It did have an 
eldridge knot though. Both looked respectable. They were watching the game of a lifetime on the television. "Alright", he suddenly said, "I bet a Thousand 
bucks James will score a 100". "I hope so", the man repied. "He's at 96, and Shawn's balling" he said. The ball left Shawn's hand, onto the pitch, and 'THWACK', 
the sound could be heard clearly from the silence. Mike's heart stopped. The ball went high. He was about to breathe out in relief, when the ball, which he 
hoped would go for a six, landed in the hands of the fielder stationed at the long leg. "Ha!", Gregor chuckled. "It's my luck", Mike said, "I really hoped he 
would've reached a century". "Yeah, me too" Gregor replied, with a horse's smile on his face. "But you owe me one grand now" he added. "Of course, treat's on me
tomorrow." The friendship of Mike and Gregor can be traced to a long time back. Before Mike married Janet, or even after, if you asked him who he prefers to 
spend his time with, his answer will always be the same. In fact, it was Gregor who introduced Mike to the world of Cricket. 
	The next day, Mike took Gregor to "The Opulent Palate", as he promised him a treat. The restaurant was known for it's unparalleled luxury dining experience, 
creative food ideas, and flawless taste. The food there was better than art, it was perfection. And the music in the background was the cherry on top. As they
finished with their dining, "Gregor," Mike said, "You know I got my bonus yesterday". "Wasn't that obvious? You never bet such a huge amount on anything"
Gregor replied. "Let me finish" Mike said. "I want to gift Janet something, our anniversary's next week, and I have no clue what to do for her"."How can I 
help buddy?" Gregor asked. "Well, you've known her since childhood, suggest something". Gregor was lost in deep thought for the next minute. Mike sighed, his
disappointment was obvious. Gregor immediately replied "She did always say she wanted to go to Paris". "Well then, Paris it is. Thanks man" Mike said. Gregor
replied, "Anytime mate". Both walked out of the restaurant with smiling faces. Gregor went straight to the subway two blocks across the street. Mike sat in his
Bentley, and drove away. Two hours later, Mike was sitting in his office, when Gregor called him. Mike was a bit busy, so he ignored the call. Mike was the 
Manager of Infinitex Cyber Services, and he had recieved news that their CEO Charlie Woodwyn was arriving in their branch. Gregor left a message, saying it was
urgent. Mike was worried. Just as Charlie was walking through the door, Janet started called him. "What could be happening?" Mike thought to himself. Charlie 
looked at Mike's face, and immediately asked, "Whats up Mike? You look worried. Everything alright?". "Yes sir, everything's fine. Thank you for asking." This
formality was just in front of other employees. Charlie and Mike were close friends, although not as close as Mike and Gregor. Charlie knew something was not 
right, and gave him the rest of the day off. Mike immediately called Gregor. "I got your message, everything okay?" Mike asked in a worried tone. "No, 
nothing is okay. Remember I told you not to invest in Prodigy? I was right to be skeptical. They just declared Bankruptcy". Mike almost started crying. "What!
I had invested over a million. But the Wall Street Guy said...", before Mike could continue, Gregor yelled from over the phone, "Screw what the Wall Street Guy
said. I told you not to do it, and you did it anyway. All your money that you invested in Progidy Group, it's gone." Mike was literally on the verge of crying.
He then called Janet, and asked her what happened. "My parents, they're missing". Mike could hear Janet crying over the phone. Could this day get any worse? 
Hopefully not. 
	Mike rushed to his in-laws place. It was a humble home, far from the city life, in the comfortable countryside. Apart from his own house, it was the only 
Mike felt happy. When Janet came to visit her parents, the door was open, and nobody was home. "Mom! Dad!" she shouted. No response. She called them on their 
phone, but in vain. They were inside the house. Janet checked their neighbour, Mr Robinson's house. "Janet! When did you come back? Come on in" he said in 
his always-happy tone. "Maybe later Mr. Robinson. Are my parents with you?" she asked, worried. "No honey. Are they not at home?" he asked back. "Have you checked
the park? They sometimes like to take a stroll these days". "They're not there. and even their phones are in the house. They didn't even lock the door." she said.
"Well that's news to me" he said. "I've even tried calling Mike, he won't take my phone." Mr Robinson pointed out, "Isn't that Mike's car?" Mike rushed towards 
Janet. "Have you tried calling them?" he asked. "Yes" she replied. "Their phones are on the couch" she added. "Janet, why don't you look for something in the 
house?" Mr Robinson said. "Maybe you will find something" he added. "Okay, Mike do me a favor. Contact Inspecter McMillion" Janet said, as she walked towards the
house. "Mike," Mr. Robinson whispered. "Don't tell this to Janet. I overheard some people talking over at the cattle farm that her parents invested in some 
scheme". "What kind of scheme?" asked Mike. "I don't know, but pretty sure it had something to do with someone named Gregor". Mike's heart stopped. "Gregor?" he 
asked. Mr. Robinson reassured it was Gregor's name that he heard. "Okay, Mr. Robinson. Thanks for the information" replied Mike. Mike tried to reach McMillion, 
but there was no response. Mike called Gregor, hoping he would have some answers, but no response from there either. Janet came back from the house, looking 
worried. "Did you try calling Gregor?" she asked. "Yes" replied Mike. "He didn't answer my calls". "That's weird. He never ignores your calls", Janet said. 
"Alright, I've gotta go. If you need any help, let me know" Mr. Robinson said, as he walked towards the cattle farm at the back of their house. "I think Gregor
has some of the answers we seek", Mike said. Janet, looking worried, asked "Well, what are you gonna do?" Janet asked. "I'm about to find out what he has been
upto these days" Mike said. "What do you mean?" Janet asked. Mike assured her he would take care of the matter, and asked her to go back home."Mike, I'm afraid" 
Janet said while crying. "I promise I will find your parents honey" Mike re-assured her. The couple sat in the Bentley at dusk. Mike dropped her off at their 
house. "Take care honey" he said. "Will you come back home tonight?" Janet asked. "I can't say for sure. Lock the house tightly, and do not let anyone inside" 
Mike said. "And if you feel afraid, you know where to find me". "You're going to Gregor's place, aren't you?" Janet asked. Mike, wiping the tear off her eyes
said "I'm going to find some answers. You know, they treated me like their son after my parents passed. I'll make sure whoever did this answers for their deed."
Saying that, he rushed his car to Gregor's house. He entered the house. Too late. Gregor was on the run. "I'll get him, sooner or later" Mike said to himself. 
	Mike returned home. Janet, still worried, asked "What happened?". "He escaped. I don't think we have a choice but to inform...", while Janet interrupted 
"No, anyone but Daniel Ramsay". "We don't have a choice. I tried to reach inspector McMillion. He didn't respond". "Fine. But I want my parents back"."I know"
Mike reported the incident to Detective Daniel Ramsay. Detective Ramsay was a man of many words. He always wore a black suit, and had a cigar in his mouth.
He was a short, chubby man who stopped at nothing to solve a mystery. His weird ways earned him a reputation. He once covered himself in mud and snuck up into
an abandoned factory just outside the city, which he suspected was the location of a smuggling business. This got him the nickname "Detective Mudslide". 
	"We'll have to start by tracking down your buddy Gregor, then we'll look into Henry Bollister" Detective Ramsay said in his broken voice. "Why Henry?"
Mike asked. "He's the CEO of Prodigy Group, right? Maybe he'll have something to say about why he didn't use his overseas investment to cover up his Bankruptcy."
"Fair enough. But Janet's parents?". "I think they are connected to this somehow. Don't worry. We'll find them". Just as Mike was about to enter his Bentley, 
he got a call from his office. "Hello?". Over the phone, "Mike, I got Good News and Bad News. Which one do you want to hear first?". "Give me the good news."
"Well, you're now the CEO of Infinitex Cyber Services"."What! What about Charlie?". "That's the bad news. Charlie passed away an hour ago. He died of a sudden
heart attack. He mentioned to some of the partners he wanted you to become CEO after him". As Mike heard this, tears flowed down his cheeks. He did not know if
these were tears of joy or grief. Should he mourn the loss of his friend, or should he celebrate the biggest promotion of his life. "This is not the time to 
celebrate." Mike thought to himself. "The company is my responsibility now. I will not disappoint you, Charlie. May your sould rest in peace". 
	Detective Ramsay asked Mike to give him the photos of Janet's parents. Ramsay went to Gregor's house at dawn. Hopping from one room to another, he hoped to
find somthing. "Bulls-eye..." He said to himself when he found a photograph. "Gregor sure left the house in a hurry. He forgot to burn this photo". He looked
at the photo for hours. When Mike came to Detective Ramsay's office with the photographs he had asked for, he was left speechless. "That's Janet's parents. 
Where did you get that photo?" Mike asked, surprised. "From Gregor's house. Seems he left in a hurry. And I think I found their location too". "Where are they?"
"Take a guess" Detective said in that god-awful voice. "Don't play mind games with me detective, I'm already stressed", Mike said. He was visibly frustrated.
"Alright, but first, I think we need to pay a visit to two fine gentlemen", the detective said. "Who?" asked Mike. "Well, their names are Bob and Chris. Does
that ring any bells?". "Nope" Mike said. "Well, we're about to find out" he said as they sat in an old Ford. It was the detective's ride. Detective Ramsay tried 
to start his car. "The damn thing won't start", the detective complained in that god-awful voice. 
"Let's just go in my Bentley", Mike said, as the duo got out of the old Ford, and got in the Bentley.

Chapter 2: Henry's Mind <br>
	"C'mon man, you gotta do better that that. You're Charlie Goddamn Woodwyn", a young man with an almost perfect face said to his buddy Charlie over the phone.
"Yeah alright, give me one more chance Henry. This time I swear I will get it right", Charlie responded over the phone. "Okay, who was the person who built the
tallest skyscraper in the world?", asked an exited Henry Bollister, who was certain that Charlie would not know the answer. "Let me think, okay?", Charlie
responded. "Was it Burlington Johnson, by any chance?", Charlie asked. "No, not even close. It's Randall Widner. Umm...", he paused for a moment. "You know what Charlie, I'll 
call you in just a moment,seems I've got some unwanted company", Henry said, as he hung up his phone. "What do you want?", Henry asked the man who had just come
into his office. "I got them to invest into our scheme", the man said. "Good job Gregor. How much did they invest?" Henry asked. "1.5 million. But there is just
one problem. Their son-in-law in my best friend. I hated doing this to him", Gregor said. "I know, but Mr. Wei has been demanding more and more. He's threatening 
to shut down overseas accounts in Prodigy Group. Now I just need to find out a way to make this money disappear from the market", Henry said. "Why don't you 
declare Bankruptcy? Mike has also invested 1.5 million. If you register Mike's 1.5 as Mr. Wei's commission, then we can keep the other 1.5 million for ourselves", 
said Gregor, with a weird smile. "But I'll need four days minimum. I'll see what I can do. And stop smiling, you look like a baboon", Henry said. Gregor seemed 
confused. "Baboon? My buddy Mike always says I look like a horse", he said as he walked away. Henry picked up the phone and called Charlie. "So, got any plans 
next week?", Henry asked him. "Nothing special. Just going to visit another branch of Infinitex. The manager there has a Bentley", Charlie, who seemed very proud
said to Henry over the phone. "A Bentley? Dude must be rich! What's his name?", asked an excited Henry. "Mike", Charlie responded.
	<i>(four days later)</i>
	Henry announced Bankruptcy. The very next moment, his phone started ringing. "Hello?", Henry asked, scared like a cat. "Henry! I cannot expect something 
smart from a fool, can I?", an absurd Chinese-sounding accent said over the phone. "Mr. Wei! What's wrong?", Henry asked, still scared like a cat. Li Wei was 
not an ordinary man, he was a spoilt one. If he got his eyes on something, nothing in this world could stop him from getting it. "You've disappointed 
me again, and again, and again. Seems I have no choice but to get rid of you", Wei said. Before Henry could say something, Mr. Wei hung up on the phone. The very
same evening, two men named Bob and Chris, who claimed to be working for Gregor appeared as uninvited guests at the house of an old couple. They sedated them, 
and arranged to get them shipped off to a Chinese warehouse, controlled by Mr. Wei. However, before they could take them away, the old couple's daughter came to 
visit her parents, so they hid them in their neighbour, Mr. Robinson's house. She panicked when she couldn't find them, and called her husband. Bob and Chris 
sent Mr. Robinson to mislead her, while they escaped out of the back door. The same evening, as Henry was leaving his office, he saw two dark figures in the 
end of the corridor. He was afraid. "Hello? Anybody there?", he asked, his voice filled with fear. "I think I'm being followed", he thought to himself. And he
had reason to believe he was being followed. He was the only person in the office at the time. Henry rushed to his car as fast as he could. He drove his Mustang 
out and drove the car in circles around Wall Street. That confirmed that he was being followed. He rushed home, and locked it with every piece of lock he could
find. He was certain it was Wei's men who were following him. As he switched off the lights of his house, he suddenly saw two men get down from a Bentley in 
front of his house. One was a short man, whom he recognized from last month's newspaper, as Detective Mudslide - The Arms Buster. The other was a fine gentleman
wearing a three piece suit. Just moments later, there was a knock on his door. "Mr. Bollister? Open the door please. Detective Daniel Ramsay here", said the 
worst voice he had heard. "No way. Get lost. Mr. Wei must've sent you my way. I don't need any protection", Henry said. "We're not because some Wei told us 
to babysit you, and we're nost certainly not here to babysit you", detective Ramsay asked. "On the contrary, it would be immensely beneficial to either of us, 
if you could just let us in. We'll be on our way before you know it", Mike added. "Who're you? And why should I trust you?" Henry asked, trying to sound as
arrogant as possible. "My name's Mike. And you have no reason to trust us. But if we were who you thought we truly were, we would've killed you by now. Open 
the damn door", Mike responded. "Get in", Henry said. As they sat down, Detective Ramsay inquired, "Who's this Wei guy?". "Answer my question first. Who are 
you?", asked Henry. "Well, I'm Detective Daniel Ramsay. And this is Mike. We are here to ask you some routine questions, as you are one of the major characters 
in this investigation", replied the Detective. "You're Mike? The guy who invested a million and a half in the Prodigy stock?", asked Henry in an obviously 
shocked voice. "Yes I am", replied Mike with a sigh. "Gregor told me a lot about you", Henry said. "You know him?", Mike asked, sounding as surprised as one 
can get. "Where can we find him?", Detective Ramsay added. "I can't say for sure. All I know is he said something about going to The New York Convention Centre
minutes before I declared Bankruptcy. He called it his 'Backup plan'. Now that the bastard has abandoned me, do whatever the hell you want with him. Now leave me 
alone!", he said, effectively screaming towards the end. "Thank you for the information", Detective said. But this interrogation left more questions unanswered 
than it intended to answer. Who was Li Wei? What did he want?
